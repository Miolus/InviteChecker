# Leaderboards

Users can create a leaderboard with the `leaderboard` commmand.
This shows the people who invited most friends to the server, of course with leaves subtracted.

**Syntax**
```
leaderboard <page : 1-99> <style : Fast / Pages>
```

### :fire: Fast Leaderboards

Released in September, Fast Leaderboards offer a way to update a leaderboard by clicking a button. Useful for big communities. To summon a Fast Leaderboard, use the normal leaderboard command and change the ˋstyleˋ option.

**Syntax**

```
leaderboard style : Fast
```

!> Leaderboards don't show users with only bonus invites right now, this will change soon.
