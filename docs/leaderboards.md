# Leaderboards

Users can create a leaderboard with the `leaderboard` commmand.
This shows the people who invited most friends to the server, of course with leaves subtracted.

### :fire: Automatic Leaderboards

You can also setup an automatic leaderboard on your server, which updates every 5 minutes. This is useful if you don't want your server's channel to be spammed with leaderboards.
You can spawn the automatic leaderboard with `live`, just delete the message and it will stop updating.
