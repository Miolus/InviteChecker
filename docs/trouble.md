# Troubleshooting

We have listed the most common errors with solutions here.
Checking the `debug` command in advance could already resolve your issue.

- ## ❌ Invites are not counted
     These are possible reasons:  
     
    * InviteChecker missing `manage server` permission  
        To fix this, go to your Server Settings and add the required permission to InviteChecker.  

    * InviteChecker's cache not being up to date  
        Running the `update` command will reload all invite links and fix this.  

    * InviteChecker is currently booting up  
        When you see a 🟡 symbol in the `debug` command, this means InviteChecker is currently loading.  
        Wait till the symbol turned 🟢 green.
