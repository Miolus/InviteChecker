# Troubleshooting

We have listed the most common errors with solutions here.

- ## Invites are not counted
    This issue occurs when you use limited invite links. These are the solutions:
    - use permanent invite links
    - use invite links with unlimited uses
    - execute the `update` command

- ## Missing permissions
    Raised when you or the bot don't have required permissions (for example `manage_guild`).
    To fix this, check your permissions and add missing.
