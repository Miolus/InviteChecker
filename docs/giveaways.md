# Giveaways

You can manage giveaways with the `giveaway` command. The bot will then ask you a few questions about your giveaway, then he'll send a message in channel of your choice. Members then can click a ðŸ¥³ emoji to take part in the giveaway. 

Winners will be automatically selected when the giveaway reached the ending time.
